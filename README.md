# COMP-5361---Python---Assignment-1
the screenshots i.e. 1.jpg and 2.jpg are the output for a random test case.
For the part 1, simply enter the statement such as "(P V Q) V (Q V R)" and run the code. 
However, the first part fails for a statement having the negation as its outermost operation.
For, the part 2, I have tried and created a logic that is very easy to understand using loops and math.
